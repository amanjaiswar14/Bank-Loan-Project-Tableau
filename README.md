# Bank Loan Report Project

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance through a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report will provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time, helping us make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends to inform our lending strategies.

## Dashboards Overview

- **Total Funded Amount**: Track the total amount of funds disbursed as loans, with MTD and MoM analysis.
- **Total Amount Received**: Monitor the total amount received from borrowers, with MTD and MoM analysis.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculate the average interest rate across all loans, with MTD and MoM variations.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, with MTD and MoM fluctuations.

### Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs
